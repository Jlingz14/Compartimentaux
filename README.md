# Probabilistic Modelling of epidemic dynamics

We propose a probabilistic approach to modelling the propagation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Madagascar, with all its specificities.
With the strategy of the Malagasy state, which consists of isolating all suspected cases and hospitalized confirmed case, we get an epidemic model with
seven compartments: susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), Asymptomatic (A), Hospitalized (H), Cured (C) and Death (D). In addition to the classical
deterministic models used in epidemiology, the stochastic model offers a natural representation of the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic.
